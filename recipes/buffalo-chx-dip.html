                Whether its a football game, party, or ordinary day, the buffalo chicken dip is always a wonderful snack to reach out to. You can eat the dip with anything you like. Chicken in a Biscuit crackers are my personal favorite to add a little extra flavor to your tastebuds! With only 5 different ingredients and a simple 20 minutees in the oven, buffalo chicken dip is always a great go-to snack!
