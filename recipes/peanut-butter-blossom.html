        These cookies are a holdiday favorite of mine. So much so that I don't even save then strictly for the holidays, but they do make nice holiday gifts!

        I remember making these cookies with my mom years and years ago. I always loved to roll the doughball into the sugar and to stick the kiss on top when they were out of the oven. Sometimes the peanut butter is just not enough and I'll stick a Reese's cup in place of the Hershey's kiss.
